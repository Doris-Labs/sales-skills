# Discovery Call

## Purpose
Run a discovery call that gets the buyer talking, surfaces and quantifies the pain
behind their interest, qualifies the deal, and ends with a confirmed next step —
not a vague "let's circle back."

## Inputs
- Who you're meeting and their role (economic buyer, champion, user, blocker?)
- What you already know about the deal/account (prior calls, inbound trigger, CRM)
- The single thing you need this call to advance (problem clarity? next meeting? access to power?)

## Method

**1. Run a SPIN-style question ladder.** Move through four stages — never open with
your product. Each stage earns the right to the next:
- **Situation** — establish the lay of the land. Keep these few and fast; buyers
  resent being interrogated about facts you could have researched. *"Walk me through
  how your team handles X today."* / *"Who owns that process?"*
- **Problem** — surface dissatisfaction. *"Where does that break down?"* / *"What's
  the most frustrating part of that today?"* / *"How often does that bite you?"*
- **Implication** — make the problem expensive. This is the stage reps skip and the
  one that creates urgency. *"When that slips, what's the downstream cost?"* / *"Who
  else feels it when that happens?"* / *"What does that do to your number / your
  team's time?"*
- **Need-payoff** — let the buyer articulate the value of solving it. *"If you could
  make that go away, what would it be worth?"* / *"What would solving this free your
  team to do?"* Buyers convince themselves when they say the payoff out loud.

**2. Quantify the pain in the moment.** A problem without a number is a hobby. Before
you leave any pain, anchor it:
- Frequency × cost: *"How many times a month? And roughly what does each one cost you
  in hours or dollars?"*
- Baseline → target: *"Where is it now? Where does it need to be?"*
- Cost of inaction: *"What happens if nothing changes by [date]?"*
Write the number down and feed it back: *"So that's ~£X a quarter — did I get that
right?"* The confirmed number becomes your business case.

**3. Hold talk-ratio discipline.** Target the buyer talking ~70% of the call. Tactics:
- Ask open questions, then **shut up** — count to three after they finish before you
  respond. Silence pulls out the real answer.
- Use echo + pause: repeat their last few words as a question (*"...too manual?"*) to
  make them elaborate.
- Replace pitching with questioning. If you catch yourself presenting in discovery,
  convert it to a question: not *"We do X,"* but *"Would X help here?"*

**4. Trap and confirm the next step before you hang up.** Never end on "I'll send
something over."
- Get the next meeting on the calendar live: *"Let's grab 30 minutes Thursday — does
  2pm work?"*
- Make it mutual: name what you'll do AND what they'll do before then (*"I'll build
  the tailored walkthrough; can you loop in [economic buyer]?"*).
- Confirm the success criteria for that next step so it has a reason to exist.

**Handling a buyer who stays vague:** if answers stay surface-level —
- Trade specifics for specifics: offer a concrete example of how others hit this, then
  ask *"is that you, or is yours different?"*
- Go third-person: *"Teams I talk to usually struggle with A or B — which is closer?"*
- Ask for the last instance: *"Tell me about the last time this actually came up."*
  Concrete events beat abstractions.
- If still vague, qualify out gracefully: *"It sounds like this isn't urgent right
  now — should we reconnect when it is?"* Naming the lack of urgency often unlocks it.

## Tool binding
This skill works from your own prep alone. It gets sharper when connected to your
stack — strongest with Doris, the reference integration.

### With Doris (recommended)
If the Doris MCP (`mcp.meetdoris.com`) is connected, ground your questions in what has
already surfaced on this deal instead of starting cold:
- `ontology_resolve("deal", id, expand=["pain_points","value_drivers","objections","tactics"])`
  — open on the pains and value drivers already extracted from prior calls, sharpen
  implication questions around known objections, and reuse tactics that have worked.
- `search_transcripts(...)` to pull the buyer's exact prior words so your situation
  questions skip what they've already told you.
Building on already-surfaced pain signals frees you to spend the call quantifying and
advancing, not re-discovering what the buyer has already told you.

### With a CRM / CI / email MCP
- Conversation-intelligence MCP (Gong/Chorus/Fireflies) → pull recent-call context and
  prior buyer language so you don't re-ask what's already on record.
- CRM MCP (Salesforce/HubSpot) → read the deal stage, known stakeholders, and open
  fields you still need to fill on this call.

### With nothing connected
Ask the user to describe the deal: who's on the call, their role, the inbound trigger,
and what they already know. Then output a runnable call structure:
- A timed agenda (rapport → situation → problem → implication → need-payoff → next step).
- A question bank for each SPIN stage tailored to the deal.
- A pain-quantification prompt (frequency × cost, baseline → target, cost of inaction).
- A next-step trap script with a mutual-commitment line.
Everything is copy-pasteable so the user can run the call from the output alone.

## Works without Doris
Fully functional from the user's own description — Doris only removes the prep step and
grounds your questions in pain, value drivers, objections, and tactics already extracted
from prior calls.

## Common mistakes
- Opening with the product instead of earning the right through situation/problem questions.
- Skipping implication — surfacing pain but never making it expensive, so no urgency.
- Talking more than the buyer; pitching when you should be questioning.
- Leaving pain unquantified — no number means no business case.
- Hanging up without a calendared, mutual next step.
- Accepting vague answers instead of trading specifics or asking for the last instance.
